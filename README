This is an archlinux package which builds FreeSWITCH from latest git.
You may clone and makepkg or use and AUR helper (yaourt, cower, etc.)
to install in archlinux.  

I seek to keep as close to the default FreeSWITCH install with a few exceptions:
 * All langauges/ modules are disabled (spidermonkey and lua)
 * say/mod_say_ru is disabled
 * dialplans/mod_dialplan_asterisk is disabled
 * applications/mod_callcenter is built and loaded
 * xml_int/mod_xml_curl is built and loaded
 * xml_int/mod_xml_cdr is loaded
